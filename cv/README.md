# Creating a CV with LaTeX

Making a CV in LaTeX is fairly chill---there's no wildly complicated formatting, and
most of the work comes in just setting everything up ones. Beyond that, you'll make 
minor additions to the document over time, but you don't need to re-create it every
time.

Some general tips:

1. Keep the project in Overleaf and/or a git repo; this will make it easy to update the document and to roll back any changes if you need to do that.
2. Use a bib file to store all of your publications. We can use some BibLaTeX magic to format your publications in a way which is amenable to how you'd want them to appear in a CV.
3. Just like with your regular bib files for papers, most reference managers like Zotero, Mendeley, and PaperPile offer a way to export references as a continuously-updated bib file, which is a great way to avoid having to keep a manual compilation of your papers.
4. It's nice to include a "last updated on ..." line somewhere in the document.

I've included a demo CV in this repo that you can use as a starting point if you'd like. It's also a great idea to look at the CVs of your fellow graduate students and the professors in the department to see how they format things.
